Title: J.S.W.A.T - JavaScript Web Application Template

Description: A custom JavaScript web application template utilizing various technologies and libraries.
J.S.W.A.T makes it easy to incorporate full stack application technologies if a simple front-end application isn't required. 
A complete project folder structure is set up with both "Frontend" & "Backend" directories within the main "Application" directory.
A few other resources are included like .gitignore, config.env, README.md, Documentation.md, Licence.md, a package.json which holds a template to the basic dependency collection J.S.W.A.T utilizes and an application_main.js file as the server entry point. Links to documentation and guides are specified below in the "Docs" section for extra insight.

Tech Stack: Node.js for the backend & EJS(Embedded JavaScript) for the frontend. 

Dependency Stack: cors, dotenv, morgan, body-parser, nodemon

Frameworks/Libraries/Dependancies Utilized: Bootstrap.css, jQuery,

INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------
CONTENTS:
---------
1. STEP 1 - CLONE A J.S.W.A.T Starter Template
2. STEP 2 - INSTALL NODE.JS
3. STEP 3 - OPEN PROJECT IN AN IDE
4. STEP 4 - TERMINAL/CLI NAVIGATION
5. STEP 5 - INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
6. STEP 6 - RUN YOUR APPLICATION
7. STEP 7 - OPEN YOUR APPLICATION IN YOUR BROWSER

STEP 1: Clone repository to desired local machine/directory, preferably the Desktop for ease of access.
  -->   Open a terminal (GitBash, Powershell, CMD).
  -->   Type or copy command: git clone "https://github.com/KryptiQ-Labs/J.S.W.A.T.git".

STEP 2: Install the latest version of Node.js from https://www.nodejs.org/en/. (SKIP IF ALREADY INSTALLED)

STEP 3: Open the J.S.W.A.T template in your favourite IDE, preferably Visual  Studio Code which can be found from https://www.code.visualstudio.com/.

STEP 4: Open up a terminal, in VS Code use press and hold "Ctrl" and "~" (Tilde). Make sure you are in the root directory of "J.S.W.A.T" in your file explorer, then in your terminal, type or copy command "cd application", then type or copy command "cd source" and you should be in "C:\USERS\YOUR-PC-NAME\DESKTOP\J.S.W.A.T\APPLICATION\SOURCE>".

STEP 5: There is no need to initialize a project config with "npm init -y", this is already done for you. Just install the dependencies you see in the package.json file and you're good to go!

STEP 6: Run your application. In your terminal type or copy command "npm start". If your application started successfully, the following event message should be displayed in your terminal otherwise go back to STEP 1 and try again, CAREFULLY! 
                                  /** SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION START
                                  > application@1.0.0 start    
                                  > nodemon application_main.js

                                  [nodemon] 2.0.19
                                  [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
                                  [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
                                  [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
                                  [nodemon] starting `node application_main.js`
                                  Application successfully deployed to Local Development Server,
                                  Server connection open, listening on
                                  HOST: localhost
